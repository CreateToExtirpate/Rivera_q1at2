                <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
                <p>The group of motorbikers were actually a well known vlogger group called Team Katagumpay. They paid for my hospital bills and my new pair of glasses. Still doing fine so God is good.</p>

            <h2>Note:</h2>
            <p>It was my sister's birthday, we were going to celebrate at Angel's Pizza. We ended up celebrating it in the hospital.</p>
